                        Recent researches has shown that playing games can help you improve your vision. To put it simply, the players had to identify visual patterns which improved their vision.
                        I was having a discussion with my friend the other day and he was telling me that heâ€™s always been a pretty good decision maker. He was talking about how he always knew what he wanted to do.
                        So I decided to do some research on what exactly makes us better decision makers. It turns out there are a lot of different factors that play into our decision-making abilities and the one that was highlighted the most was playing video games.
